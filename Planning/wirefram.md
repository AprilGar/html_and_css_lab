I wanted to make a website for an online coaching business. 

The website looks to give my insights into what online coaching can do and bring in new clients. 

The website will have a home page that has lots of images, limited infomation but access to a form to register interest. This can be broken down into:
1. Header which will include a navigation menu that will (eventually) link to pages with more info. 
2. There will be an image collage using CSS grid. 
3. Then flexbox is used to have 3 items positioned horizontally. 
4. An interest form wil then be present. 
5. Footer will include contact details and copyright. 

See the wireframe image within the planning folder for further information.
